    <p>December 17, Fort Lee, NJ—COVID-19 positivity rates continue to rise across New Jersey, with growing hot zones in urban and commuter counties like Middlesex, Bergen, Essex and Passaic.</p>

    <p>As of Thursday, 4,255 new cases have been reported across the Garden State, many of them concentrated in these densely-populated neighborhoods, with residents traveling into and out-of New York each day.
    </p>

    <p>Hospitalizations have remained relatively flat for over a week, with 3,635 hospital beds currently occupied. Of these hospitalized New Jersians, 715 are receiving intensive care, 480 are on ventilators and 461 were discharged on Thursday.</p>

    <p>77 new, COVID-19-related deaths have been reported, pushing the state-wide death-toll since the beginning of the pandemic over the 18,000 mile-marker. </p>
    <p>“These numbers will not magically return to zero because we’re about to provide our first vaccinations,” Governor Phil Murphy said in his most-recent COVID-19 briefing. “For us to reach the level of so-called ‘herd immunity,’ it will
      require 70% of New Jersey’s adults to be vaccinated.” </p>
